This pet project was created in order to train the skills of introducing machine learning models into the web interface.

The task is to predict the time series of the hourly electricity consumption of the UPSU of Ukraine.

XGBoost selected as core ML algorythm, which learns from the generated features

Django is selected as the web framework

PostgreSQL is selected as the DBMS

The project was developed when I was just learning to program. 
I hope you enjoy playing with my application =)
